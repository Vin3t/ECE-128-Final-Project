# ECE-128-Final-Project
The purpose of this project is to implement a 2×2 matrix multiplier, and display the results on a seven-segment display. Due to the board resource limitations; the max digit is restricted to 9 for each element in the matrix. Matrix multiplication is a fundamental operation in many areas of engineering for applications such as graphics processing, signal processing, and machine learning. Efficient hardware implementation of matrix multiplication enables faster computation and real-time processing which is important for embedded systems and FPGA applications. This demonstration shows how simple digital logic components such as combinational multipliers, registers, and debouncing can create this component.
